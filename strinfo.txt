Breeding cannabis strains is like breeding dogs: everyone wants to mix and match their own. 
Both cannabis and dog breeding are done for the same purpose of developing a specialized product. 
This is to say that while your dog may have been bred for herding sheep, 
marijuana has been bred to develop the ideal high for a particular situation. 
More than 1,000 strains of cannabis have been bred during the past several decades. 
(This has been done in fields, garages, gardens, sketchy basements; 
you name a place, weed has probably been grown there at some point). 
By having such a wide diversity becoming increasingly more available, 
it is becoming more critical that individuals are aware of the types 
of efficacy available to them. While some strains are most appropriate 
for creativity, alertness and energy, others are more effective at relieving pain, 
insomnia, and lack of appetite. Knowing what strain you are smoking can ensure the
best possible therapeutic high.
