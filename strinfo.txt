Breeding cannabis strains is like breeding dogs: everyone wants to mix and match their own.
Both cannabis and dog breeding are done for the same purpose of developing a specialized product. 
This is to say that while your dog may have been bred for herding sheep, 
marijuana has been bred to develop the ideal high for a particular situation. 
More than 1,000 strains of cannabis have been bred during the past several decades. 
(This has been done in fields, garages, gardens, sketchy basements; 
you name a place, weed has probably been grown there at some point). 
By having such a wide diversity becoming increasingly more available, 
it is becoming more critical that individuals are aware of the types 
of efficacy available to them. While some strains are most appropriate 
for creativity, alertness and energy, others are more effective at relieving pain, 
insomnia, and lack of appetite. Knowing what strain you are smoking can ensure the
best possible therapeutic high.

Cannabis is a genus of flowering plants in the family Cannabaceae. The actual number of
subspecies is highly disputed, since the differences between them have yet to be genetically
identified, however three main subspecies are widely recognized based on the effects that the
bud has on the brain. These subspecies are: Indica, sativa, and ruderalis. Ruderalis plants
have a much smaller yield in relation to indica and sativa plants and tend to contain less medicinal
properties. Because of this, ruderalis strains are usually less common and are avoided by widespread
breeders. Indica and sativa are the real moneymakers in the cannabis industry: the right and left Twix bars.
(Ruderalis is the wrapper; nobody likes it).

In addition to psychological effect, indica and sativa plants also differ in their physical appearance.
Indicas are relatively short, conical and densely branched. Bearing short and broad leaflets, indicas are
referred to as the “stocky strains”. Sativa plants are much taller and laxly branched in comparison,
with relatively long and narrow leaflets.
