While the tobacco industry does its best to obscure the negative
effects of nicotine, cannabis is one of the safest intoxicating substances
on the planet.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The core component in marijuana (and what gets you high) is a chemical
compound known as delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Being an <i> agonist, </i>
or activator, of the cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB1), THC affects the brain in a
variety of ways. Brain imaging studies have shown increased blood flow to the
prefrontal cortex region of the brain during THC intoxication. This region of
the brain is responsible for decision-making, attention, and other executive
functions, like motor skills. The degree at which THC can affect these functions
varies from person to person; no two brains are identical.
